Automatic Topic Detection for Research Papers,We propose an automatic method for detecting research topics from paper abstracts using TF-IDF and clustering. Experiments show coherent topic groups across computer science subfields.
Neural Models for Scientific Document Classification,This paper explores neural network architectures applied to scientific document classification and compares them with classical bag-of-words baselines.
Survey on Topic Modeling Techniques,"A comprehensive survey of topic modeling techniques including LDA, NMF and modern transformer-based approaches with evaluation metrics."
Biomedical Literature Topic Discovery,We apply topic modeling to biomedical literature to identify emerging themes in genomics and clinical research using domain-specific preprocessing.
Citation-aware Topic Summarization,Introduce a citation-aware summarization that leverages citation contexts to improve topic summaries and highlight influential works.
Cross-lingual Topic Identification,Techniques for identifying topics across languages using multilingual embeddings and transfer learning are evaluated on parallel corpora.
Interactive Visualizations for Topic Exploration,We present an interactive visualization tool that helps researchers explore discovered topics and related documents in large paper collections.
Mining Trends from Conference Proceedings,Temporal topic modeling applied to conference proceedings to analyze emerging trends and shifts in research focus over time.
Clustering Research Papers with TF-IDF and KMeans,"A practical guide to clustering research papers using TF-IDF features and KMeans, including evaluation and hyperparameter tuning."
Evaluating Topic Coherence Metrics,This study compares different topic coherence metrics and their correlation with human judgments on scientific corpora.
Domain Adaptation for Topic Models,We investigate domain adaptation strategies to transfer topic models trained on one scientific domain to another with minimal labeled data.
Automated Survey Generation from Topics,Method for generating brief surveys of a field by automatically selecting representative papers per topic and synthesizing summaries.
Short-Text Topic Modeling for Paper Titles,Approaches for discovering topics from short-text inputs like titles using enriched context and external knowledge bases.
Keyword Extraction to Aid Topic Discovery,This paper studies keyword extraction algorithms and how extracted keywords improve downstream topic discovery tasks.
Scaling Topic Discovery to Million-Document Corpora,Engineering techniques and approximation methods to scale topic discovery pipelines to millions of documents with constrained memory.
